This post is not a technical one, I joined RedisLabs as a Solution Architect
about 2 years ago and I think that this is the right time to sumarize my
experience at RedisLabs. This company seems to have a very good recipe of
success in keeping his employees and limit turn-over by making them happy. 

First of all, I was never asked to write this post, I decided to write it by
myself to tell my experience. As you can guess, English is not my native
language and I might write ambiguous words. In such a case, there is no
ambiguity, I wanted to write the positive understanding of each potential
ambiguity in this post.

# My initial expectation

I am an Open Source addict, a technology addict, a geek... I love to find
solutions when I meet a problem, I often define myself as a swiss army knife. I
need light management. I love too much to work from home office and traveling to
prospects and customers. I'm curious about everything and need time to
investigate in new technologies (from designing and soldering electronic
hardware to software).


# The company

When I joined, a new manager was hired in the US and it was impossible to have
some kind of micro-management. He was smart and gave us enought autonomy. We
were free to organize ourself as we wanted as long as our tasks were completed.
No need for detailled reporting, neither. He was always smiling, asking how
thigs were going, taking care of our family...

When I joined, we were 9 solution architect to cover the world, and 3 only in
Europe. Now, we are approximately 40 in the world and 10 in Europe. Because of
the headcount and of the time difference with California, one of us became SA
manager for Europe, reporting to him. He made the right choice. Our The European
manager knows perfectly our territories, and more than each territory, the
cultural differences between territories. He also refuses to micro-manage us or
to ask us for too many reports (updating few fields in Salesforce is enough). 

I think that a manager should have some qualities, such as trying to help his
colleagues, trying to make things smooth, trying to accelerate processes, trying
to grow his team. By growing, I not only mean by numbers, but by education,
promotion, ... Our European manager does all of that  as well as his manager,
and very probably the top management. 

Ok, so, I work in a protected bubble with two levels of good management ? No,
not only. This positive spirits is also present at the VP level and at the CxO
level. All these qualities seems to be present in every managing level. This is
in the DNA of RedisLabs. 

In Silicon Valley startups, when you have an idea to improve things, you can try
to implement it by yourself, to proove that it works, and then, it can be
accepted. RedisLabs is different : when you have a new idea to improve things,
you have to implement it and to proove it, and RedisLabs will help you and
provide you what you need. When I wanted to try a disruptive meetup, I had to
proove my motivation first by finding the right people to ask help for. It took
few days, and I was supported in my initiative despite people were not fully
convinced by the idea. They gave me a chance to proove this concept and they
supported me. I was new in the company and they trusted me. This behavior is not
coming from invidual people, but from the company itself. This makes a real
difference.

I have read that former employees complained about transparency. Nothing is
perfect and I am quite often the very first to complain about everything (I'm
French). Honestly, I never complained about this, Once again, our managers are
very transparent and give us information as soon as they have it. Sometimes,
quite rarely, they can forget to give us information or they can not share it,
it can happen and I would not blame them. 

I prefer to work for open-source startups. We are often completely spread across
the world. We need to work together. I personnaly think that I need to know
people to be efficient. I don't work efficiently with a phone number or an email
address, I work efficiently with people and I need to be able to put a face on
each name. This is one of the reasons why I prefer to work for small companies.
When I joined, I was the 100th employee world wide, it is quite easy to put a
face on each name. We are now approximately 250. 



I spent more than two years at RedisLabs and I feel like I joined yesterday.
