[Couchbase], has a full CEAN stack (Couchbase Express Angular NodeJS) to quickly
develop [NodeJS] application. We will see in this tutorial how to initialize the
development of a new NodeJS application using CEAN with Yeoman, create a
server-side service, a controller and views for client side graphical and modern
representation of data

Prerequisites
=============
As for all my tutorials, there are prerequisites. Here are those to implement
this small application.

Operating System
----------------
I'm a big fan of Debian since 1999, so I will use this Linux distribution to
create my application. Commands will be very similar on Debian-derived
distributions (Ubuntu) and their derivatives (Mint). You will certainly have to
adapt them for other distributions and other operating systems (BSD, Windows,
MacOS), but the NodeJS application should remain the same.

I will use a fresh default Debian install, only with the standard set of
packages (no GUI, no print server, no HTTP server, ...).

Couchbase Server
----------------
First, we must obviously have a [Couchbase] cluster at least in version 4.0. At
the time of this writing, it is available for [download] on the Couchbase
website.  This cluster must have at least one node with the *Index* service and
at least one node with the *Query* service.


Couchbase's CEAN stack installation
=========================================

We'll see how to install step by step the [CEAN] stack on a Debian GNU/Linux 8
(jessie) distribution. For this, we will follow the official website
instructions.

I install the installation dependencies and NodeJS:

```sh
sudo aptitude install -y git gcc make nodejs nodejs-legacy npm
```

I make sure that I have the latest version of `npm` available to avoid errors
and warnings during the installation of other dependencies:

```sh
sudo npm install -g npm
```

I then use *NodeJS Package Manager* to install *yeoman*. The CEAN generator for
*yeoman* will need *bower* to install the dependencies of my future application.
Although *grunt* is optional, it will facilitate the development of my
application, so I install it all:

```sh
sudo npm install -g yo bower grunt grunt-cli
```

Then, I install the CEAN generator for *yeoman* and make it available:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dmaier-couchbase/cean.git
cd cean/src/yeoman-generators/generator-cean
sudo npm link
cd
```

Voil√†, all the dependencies are ok to generate a CEAN application skeleton.

Application creation
====================

For this tutorial, I'm using a small dataset. The schema is very simple: each
document lists the annual values of a Development Indicator between 2006 and
2012 for a given country and a given indicator. As we will access to documents
for a country and a given indicator, we will use this information as a primary
key, even if we do not use these key directly (we will make N1QL requests and
not Key / Value).

Data loading
------------

We must first create a small bucket in the Couchbase cluster and name it <<
WorldDataBank >>. I will not describe in detail how to create a new bucket.
Simply connect to the Couchbase Cluster Administration interface using a browser
with an administrator account , then go in the << Buckets >> tab, click on the
<< New bucket >> button. There is no need to give more than 100 MB of memory to
this bucket.

Then, the easiest way is to download the [dataset] that I have prepared for this
tutorial, and unzip the compressed archive:

```sh
unzip WorldDataBank.dump.zip
```

You need to upload the resulting folder on a computer which has the *Couchbase*
backup and restore tools :

```sh
scp -r WorldDataBank.dump user@name_of_one_cluster_node:
```

and to connect to this computer's command line interface :

```sh
ssh user@cluster_node_name
```

Then, you need to load it in the << WorldDataBank >> bucket thanks to the
`cbrestore` restore tool, as in the following sample (dont forget to replace
localhost by the address or the name of one of the cluster's nodes):

```sh
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbrestore -u Administrator -p Administrator /home/vagrant/WorldDataBank.dump http://localhost:8091/ -b WorldDataBank
```

As we will use *N1QL*, we need to create at least the primary index. So, we will
use the command line query tool provided by *Couchbase* :
`/opt/couchbase/bin/cbq` to execute the following SQL commands :

```sql
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON WorldDataBank USING GSI;
CREATE INDEX Cat ON WorldDataBank(Category) USING GSI;
CREATE INDEX Counry ON WorldDataBank(Country_Name) USING GSI;
```

Now, we can check that the data are available and that we can execute *N1QL*
queries. Still in the command line query tool, you can try a *N1QL* query :

```sql
SELECT YR2006,YR2007 FROM WorldDataBank WHERE Country_Name='FRA' AND Category='LEB';
```

And you should get the following answer :

```json
{
    "requestID": "11fcb1ff-59ab-4c6a-9b72-fb6782a2d154",
    "signature": {
        "YR2006": "json",
        "YR2007": "json"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "YR2006": "81.1121951219512",
            "YR2007": "81.2146341463415"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "42.479238ms",
        "executionTime": "42.479087ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 94
    }
}
```

Application skeleton initialization
-----------------------------------

*Yeoman* is an application skeleton generator. [CEAN] is provided as a skeleton
generator for *Yeoman*. We will use it to initialize our future application
skeleton. The generator will create the application folders, populate them with
source file templates and install all the dependencies that our application will 
need to work properly.

```sh
mkdir myapp
cd myapp/
yo cean myapp
```

I noticed that the Couchbase C library (*libcouchbase*) is not always
properly installed. We will force this installation manually to be sure :

```sh
npm install couchbase
```

It is time to check that our sample application skeleton was generated and that
all the dependencies are installed :

```sh
grunt
```

Route addition to execute a N1QL query
--------------------------------------

We will begin by creating a new route on the server that maps a parametrized
URL to a *N1QL* query execution, passing the parameters. This server-side route
will be called by the client-side service. In order to add the route and the
associated logic, we will add it to the `routes/demo.js` file :

```js
/**
 * Get a N1ql Resultset
 */
router.get('/getN1ql', function (req, res) {
    var countryId = req.query.countryId;
    var categoryId = req.query.categoryId;

    if (helper.isDefined(countryId)&&helper.isDefined(categoryId))
    {
        var q="SELECT YR2006, YR2007, YR2008, YR2009, YR2010, YR2011, YR2012 FROM WorldDataBank WHERE Country_Name='"+countryId+"' AND Category='"+categoryId+"'";
        console.log("N1QLQUERY:" + q);
        var n1qlQuery = couchbase.N1qlQuery.fromString(q);
        bucket.query(n1qlQuery,
                function(err, cbres) {
                    if (err) {
                        var emsg = "Could not get the document!";
                        console.log("ERROR" + emsg);
                        res.json({ "error" : emsg });

                    } else {
                        console.log("Got " + JSON.stringify(cbres));
                        res.json(cbres);
                    }
                });
    }
    else
    {
        var emsg = "Did you pass all mandatory parameters?";
        console.log("ERROR: " + emsg);
        res.json({"error" : emsg});
    }
});
```

This method builds the *N1QL* query, fill the parameters, send it on the
server's console to log, and execute it. In case of error, it is also sent to
the console and back to the client's service, otherwise the result is written to
the console and sent back to the client.

It is possible to test the route from an internet browser with the following
URL `http://localhost:9000/service/getN1ql?countryId=FRA&categoryId=LEB` that
should return the following result (pretty printed here for the tutorial) :

```json
[
    {
        "YR2006":"81.1121951219512",
        "YR2007":"81.2146341463415",
        "YR2008":"81.4146341463415",
        "YR2009":"81.6634146341463",
        "YR2010":"82.1146341463415",
        "YR2011":"81.9682926829268",
        "YR2012":"81.9682926829268"
    }
]
```

N1QL querying method addition in the client-side service
--------------------------------------------------------

The idea is that the client embeds a service that can be used to query the
server on an URL (and a route with an associated function). We already defined
the route with two parameters on the server, we will now create the client-side
service to be called.

We will add a new method in the already existing service `myservice` to query
the Couchbase cluster. Here is the method to add in the
`public/scripts/services/myservice.js` file to get the yearly values given a
country and an indicator name :

```js
TMyService.prototype.getN1ql = function(countryId,categoryId)
{
    var url = "/service/getN1ql?countryId=" + countryId + "&categoryId=" + categoryId;
    var promise = this.httpService.get(url, {}).success(function (data) { /*Allows to handle the result and errors */ });
    return promise;
}
```

Now, the client-side, in the browser, embeds a javascript service that can be
called with two parameters. This service will asynchroneously call (without
waiting for the result) an URL on the server-side, passing the parameters. The
server will use the route to map this URL call with the parameters to a function
that will generate and execute a N1QL query and return the result to the
client-side service.

D3js and nvD3 installation
--------------------------

We will use the [D3] library to render the results with charts. In order to make
it easier, we will use the [nvD3] wrapping library and its port to Angular,
[Angular-nvD3].

The following command line will install it when executed from the application
folder :

```sh
bower install angular-nvd3
```

Theorically, it should automatically install all the dependencies (Angular, [D3]
and [nvD3]). Nevertheless, as a precaution, in case of dependency installation
failure, it is still possible to manually install them :

```sh
bower install angular
bower install d3
bower install nvd3
```

We will also add all these dependencies installation in the bower's
configuration file, `bower.json` :

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.3.x",
    "json3": "^3.3.0",
    "es5-shim": "^4.0.0",
    "bootstrap": "^3.2.0",
    "angular-cookies": "1.3.x",
    "angular-resource": "1.3.x",
    "angular-route": "1.3.x",
    "angular-nvd3": "~0.1.1",
    "nvd3": "~1.8.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "angular-mocks": "1.3.x",
    "angular-scenario": "1.3.x"
  },
  "appPath": "app"
}
```

Chart and input controls addition in the main view
--------------------------------------------------

First, lets add the library inclusion in our application, in the
`public/scripts/app.js` file :

```javascript
/**
 * @ngdoc overview
 * @name cbDemoQaApp
 * @description
 * # 'myapp
 *
 * Main module of the application.
 */
var app = angular.module('myapp', [
    'ngCookies',
    'ngResource',
    'nvd3',
    'ngRoute'
]);

app.config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
    .when('/', {
       templateUrl : 'views/main.html',
       controller : 'MyCtrl'
    })
    .otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/'
    });
});
```

Then, you need to add the required lines to generate and display the chart in
the `public/index.html` file headers :

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.css">
    <script src="bower_components/d3/d3.js"></script>
    <script src="bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.js"></script> <!-- or use another assembly -->
    <script src="bower_components/angular-nvd3/dist/angular-nvd3.js"></script>
```

The application use an *MVC* architecture (Model-View-Controler) with templates.
We will add the input controls in the main view file `public/views/main.html` to
enable the parameter selection. We will also remove the sample application
button :

```html
<div ng-include="'views/header.html'"/>
<div class = "row marketing">
    <div class = "well">
        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>
            {% raw %}{{msg}}{%endraw%}
        </p>
        <nvd3 options="options"
              data="data"
              config="config"
              events="events"
              api="api"></nvd3>
    </div>
    <form id="add" role="form">
    <select id="selectCountry" class="btn btn-default" ng-click="onFilterChange()">
        <option value="FRA">France</option>
        <option value="CAN">Canada</option>
        <option value="DEU">Germany</option>
    </select>
    <select id="selectCategory" class="btn btn-default" ng-click="onFilterChange()">
        <option value="LBTP">Population</option>
        <option value="LEB">Life expectancy at birth</option>
        <option value="NID">Number of infant death</option>
    </select>
        <!--button id="buttonAdd" class="btn btn-default" ng-click="onAddClicked()">Add Test Document</button-->
    </form>
</div>
<div ng-include="'views/footer.html'"/>
```

Controler change to query the cluster and update the chart with the answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will now write the client-side code that triggers the service call when the
input control values are changed, passing them as parameters and that updates
the chart when the results are received (asynchroneously). Lets change the main
controller file `scripts/controllers/mycontroller.js` to add this function :

```javascript
   $scope.onFilterChange = function () {
       var countryId=document.getElementById("selectCountry").value;
       var categoryId=document.getElementById("selectCategory").value;

       MyService.getN1ql(countryId,categoryId).then(
           function(ctx) {
               var result = ctx.data;
                $scope.options = {
                    chart: {
                        type: 'discreteBarChart',
                        height: 450,
                        margin : {
                            top: 20,
                            right: 20,
                            bottom: 60,
                            left: 55
                        },
                        x: function(d){ return d.label; },
                        y: function(d){ return d.value; },
                        showValues: true,
                        valueFormat: function(d){
                            return d3.format(',.2f')(d);
                        },
                        transitionDuration: 500,
                        xAxis: {
                            axisLabel: 'Years'
                        },
                        yAxis: {
                            axisLabel: categoryId,
                            axisLabelDistance: 30
                        }
                    }
                };

                $scope.data = [{
                    key: "Cumulative Return",
                    values: [
                        { "label" : "2006" , "value" : result[0].YR2006 },
                        { "label" : "2007" , "value" : result[0].YR2007 },
                        { "label" : "2008" , "value" : result[0].YR2008 },
                        { "label" : "2009" , "value" : result[0].YR2009 },
                        { "label" : "2010" , "value" : result[0].YR2010 },
                        { "label" : "2011" , "value" : result[0].YR2011 },
                        { "label" : "2012" , "value" : result[0].YR2012 }
                        ]
                    }];
           }
        );
   }
```

Final testing
-------------

If you stopped `grunt`, you need to restart it :

```sh
grunt

```

You can now connect your internet browser to the IP address or hostname and port
that your application is listening on `http://localhost:9000/` and you should be
able to use your brand new shiny application :

![Application]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/CeanAndD3/application.png)

The server's console should list all the N1QL queries that are generated and the
returned results:

```sh
N1QLQUERY:SELECT YR2006, YR2007, YR2008, YR2009, YR2010, YR2011, YR2012 FROM
WorldDataBank WHERE Country_Name='FRA' AND Category='LBTP'
Got
[{"YR2006":64012572,"YR2007":64371099,"YR2008":64702921,"YR2009":65023142,"YR2010":65338149,"YR2011":65635082,"YR2012":65920302}]
```

Voila
=====

You have seen how to bootstrap a new NodeJS application based on the CEAN stack,
how the routes, services, controllers, and views work, how to execute a
parametrized N1QL query, get the results and display the results in an
interactive D3 chart.
