Fail2ban parses log files, looking for attack attempts and take countermeasures to ban the attacker temporarily or permanently using IPTables and TCPWrapper rules. Configuration with TARPIT IPtables targets to "punish" attackers. This post describe the basic and common installation setup, I specialize it depending on the server type (public or gateway/router) in the next posts.

# Fail2ban presentation

Fail2Ban parses the log files and searches for typical attack patterns, when the same source IP has several authentication failure, or tries to scan the server, ... The attack was successfully blocked by the first line of defense, IPTables rules or TCPWrappers, but continues. It is probably not a mistake, but a real attack and it is time to implement more than just blocking each attempt. 

Fail2ban can execute arbitrary commands to block the source IP for a given amount of time, it can also send email with details to the admin, add the source IP to public blacklists or trigger active countermeasures. 

Automatic countermeasures is not a good idea, email notification can rapidly fil your mailbox without any great value, and adding bad ips to public blacklists would need to open outgoing network connections and I personnally do not find automatic blacklist addition as a reliable action. We have to keep in mind that the attacks are rarely comnig directly from the attacker machines, but from a botnet, a machine network made of innocent machines infected by a virus. All these actions would punish innocent victims way too strongly, from my point of view.

# Prerequisites
This article only depends on the [Generic machine preparation](/pages/en/tags/#debian11-preparation).

## Existing variables
We need the `LAN_*` variable which is already defined in the configuration file, in [010 - Configuration variables](/Debian111PostInstall010Configurationvariables-en/).

## Reload the variables
Ensure that the variables are available, by loading the configuration script :
```bash
source /root/config.env
```

# Common Installation
The package is small, easy and fast to install, it asks no questions by default.
```bash
apt-get install -y fail2ban
```

## Second level ban of already banned connections
When a pattern is repeated, Fail2Ban triggers a temporary action to block further attempts for a specified time. This rule acts as a second level to take more restrictive actions when the attempts are continuing while blocked.
```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/recidive.conf
[recidive]
enabled = true
EOF
```

## TARPIT malicious connections
Instead of simply ignoring the incoming network paquets to block them, I chose to send them to the TARPIT target. I described this target in the [IPTable post](), we already know that this trafic is malicious, it does not hurt or consume local resources and it should stop the attack attempts directly at the source.
```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-common.local
[Init]
blocktype = TARPIT
EOF
```

## Whitelist my IP or LAN
Normal usage should not be impacted, but it might be advisable to whitelist our own public IP address to avoid any mistake.
```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
[DEFAULT]
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ${LAN_IP}/${LAN_NM}
#action = %(action_mw)s
EOF
```

## Tune the ban duration
I also adjust the temporary ban time to 1 hour, way more longer than the default. 
```bash
cat << EOF >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
bantime = 3600
EOF
```

## Tune the detection thresholds
Finally, I tell `fail2ban` to trigger then ban when it finds more than 3 attempts during the last 10 minutes, in order to detect slow attacks.
```bash
cat << EOF >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
findtime = 600
maxretry = 3
EOF
```

## Apply the configuration
```bash
systemctl restart fail2ban
```

# Administration
Keep in mind that this tool will dynamically block connections. You can use `fail2ban-client` to manage the currently banned hosts with the `banned`, `ban` and `unban` commands. These commands are available with the version included in Debian 11 Bullseye, but not in the version included in Debian 10 Buster. When a host is banned, it will be added to an `iptable` chain, visible in `iptable -L -n -v` output and in the TCPWrapper's `/etc/hosts.deny` blacklist file.
