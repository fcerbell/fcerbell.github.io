Passionated by computers since the age of 8, I played a lot with BASIC, QBasic, QuickBasic, assembly, Pascal, C and C++ until I discovered Linux in 1994 and I became addicted by the Free Open Source world. My games became Bash, Perl, PHP, the network protocols, software integration, administration and automation.

As time went on, I accumulated a lot of small knowledge that I never really publicly shared. Here is the opportunity to lay on the couch and to tell you everything.

I will probably also share on other topics such as photo or cooking.
